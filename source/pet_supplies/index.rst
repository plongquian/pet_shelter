Pet Supplies
============
In general, no matter what animal anyone adopts there are specific necessities one needs to take care of an animal. Some are more obvious than others. But, here are what we think are the most important supplies to have for your animal to have before you come pick them up for adoption. 
 * Food and water bowls
 * Food (canned or dry)
 * A leash (if you feel necessary)
 * ID tag with your phone number, name and list of vaccinations
 * Plastic carrier or metal crate (if you feel necessary)
 * Bed
 * Shampoo and conditioner

This list can vary from different types of animals, from big to small, furry to scaly, tame or exotic. We highly encourage that you do your research when looking into adopting any pet to fidn out what maintenance they require and need. THis can help you know if you are able to suitably take care of the animal.

We hope you found the pet you wanted to adopt here with us! Be sure to always look into adopting and encourage others to adopt.

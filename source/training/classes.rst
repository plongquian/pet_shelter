    We host classes that go over information vital to different areas 
    of owning a pet.

During each of our classes we go over different areas that are important
to owning a pet.  Ranging from what food to buy, grooming and ways it can
be done without being a harm, excercise for your animal and of course,
love and care.  We want you to learn these skills as well as your pet;

will take care of your pet for the remainder if the session.  Otherwise
it is recommended to join in this experience.

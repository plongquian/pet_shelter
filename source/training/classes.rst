    *We host classes that go over information vital to different areas 
    of owning a pet.*

During each of our classes we go over different areas that are important
to owning a pet.  Ranging from what food to buy, grooming and ways it can
be done without being a harm, excercise for your animal and of course,
love and care.  We want you to learn these skills as well as your pet;
however, if you are busy during the class times there are volunteers that
will take care of your pet for the remainder if the session.  Otherwise
it is recommended to join in this experience.

Pet Edicate
-----------

Is your pet well mannered?  Are skills like potty training and guest 
welcoming tough to try and teach?  If so then look no further, Pet 
Edicate is what you're looking for.  Our four week course ranges over two 
and a half hours Monday, Wednesday and Friday evenings.  Throughout this 
class we go over the behavior of your pet in an interactive environment.

Grooming
--------

A clean relationship with you and your pet pretty much starts with a 
clean pet.  In this class we go over hygienic essentials such as when, 
why and how to bathe your pet.  Unlike our Edicate course, Grooming is a 
night class that runs Monday Wednesday and Friday.  Along with the class 
there will be opportunities to purchase the appliances used in our 
classes for yourself or a friend.

Breeding
--------

Expecting a new furry friend? Well we got you covered!  In our Breeding 
course we help walk you through your pet's pregnancy and their little 
one's arrival.  Being one of the more content heavy classes there will be 
4 morning classes a week which will take place Monday, Tuesday, Thursday 
and Friday.  As a bonus we will also shortly go over how to handle
raising a newborn

Pet Health
----------

Easily the most expensive and important course we offer, we value your 
pets health at a very high standard.  During Pet Health, we address any 
issues common for whatever pet you have.  Also whatever health issue your 
pet has we will work to treat as well as provide you with proper 
medication.  Being the most expensive class we provide the medications we 
believe necessary to have given the topic or circumstance.  This class 
runs Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday Evenings.

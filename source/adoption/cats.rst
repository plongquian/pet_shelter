Meet Martin! Martin is a male Domestic Longhair who is 2 years old. He
is extremely smart, sweet, and silly. He enjoys sleeping in the sun, 
playing with laser pointers, and to eat! He loves to meet new people, 
and is not shy when it comes to greeting others with a good rub to the
ankle. Martin will make for a great pet in a home with or without children.

Precious Polly is what we like to call her here at the shelter! Polly is 
a female Domestic Longhair kitten who is 7 months old. She is extremely
cuddly and takes any chance to sleep in your lap that she can get. Since
she is just a kitten, she takes a little time to adjust to new people. Once 
she does, good luck forgetting this ball of fur! She is a lover, is smart, 
and loves to play.

Don't let their names fool you, Rascal and Rebel are two of our most 
well-behaved felines in the shelter. They are bonded together, so they
must be adopted as a pair. You can find information on the two of them
in the lists below.

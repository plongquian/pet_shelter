Everyone Needs a Man's Best Friend

Is there anything better than being greeted by a wagging tail
when you get home from work? No, there isn't. We have plenty
of pups and dogs that are looking for their forever home. 

Tank

This is Tank. He is a St. Bernard puppy who is 9 months old. He came
to us from a family who realized that this pup was going to outgrow
their home quickly. Tank is sweet, and loves to play as any young puppy
does. He will do best in a home with a lot of room to play. He loves 
children too, and is very gentle around them.

Meet our sweet boy Chase. Chase is a black lab who is 5 years old. He 
is one of our older animals in the shelter, but that doesn't seem to 
slow him down. He loves to play fetch more than any other four-legged
friend we have looked after. Chase is a smaller male, so he will do well
in any size of home.

Piper is one of our pups that has a background in training. She has a long
list of tricks that she is already able to do, and has extremely good 
behavior. She takes a little time to adjust to new people, and gets nervous
around children. She would do better in a home with more mature individuals,
and that has lots of good places to nap.

Why Should You Adopt?
---------------------

There are an abundant amount of reasons for why you should adopt 
a pet from a shelter rather than buying from a breeder or another
source is better for you and the overall pet population.
You will change a life of the pet. You will get a great animal.
You will save money. You'll get a healthy, vet-checked pet. 
You will receive ongoing help from Simpson College Pet Shelter 
whenever it is needed.

*You will feel better.*

When you adopt, you are giving the pet the second chance that
it deserves. Not only are you helping your new friend, but you 
will be allowing the shelter to help other animals in need. We want
to be the destination for animals that have no other place to go. 
Though each animal arrives at our shelter for its own reasons, they
are all searching for the same things: love and a family of their 
own. Adoption is not just the right thing to do; it is a reward
that keeps on giving.

Simpson College Pet Shelter makes the adoption process seamless, as
we are right by your side every step of the way. If you are interested
in more information, please visit our About page where you will find
our phone number, email address, our location, and our hours.

Volunteer!
==========

Welcome to Simpson College Pet Shelter. We are always looking for new volunteers and we are excited to get to know you! 
There are many ways to volunteer and support Simpson College Pet Shelter ranging from simply playing with dogs to helping us organize adoption events and fundraisers.
No one volunteer position is better than another and they are all incredibly rewarding. 
Volunteering with rescue animals can be some of the most gratifying volunteer work that can be had. It is a wonderful feeling when you can bond with so many different animals and help them find their forever homes.
Below we have all of the different ways you can get involved!

* We are always in need of volunteers to come and play with our animals at the shelter! See below for times available!
* If you are capable, we also accept gifts in the form of cash, check, or credit card, as well as gifts of dog or cat food, toys, leashes and collars! Learn more on our `Donations`_ page.
* We welcome groups to come and volunteer for the day at the shelter! Please contact us for more information, if you are interested.

Welcome to Simpson College Pet Shelter. We are always looking for new volunteers and we are excited to get to know you. 
There are many ways to volunteer and support Simpson College Pet Shelter ranging from simply playing with dogs to helping us to organize adoption events and fundraisers.
No one volunteer position is better than another and they are all incredibly rewarding. 
Volunteering with rescue animals can be some of the most rewarding volunteer work that can be had and it is extremely rewarding,
and a wonderful feeling when you can bond with so many different animals and help them find their forever home.
Below we have all of the different ways that you can get involved!

Vaccinations
============

The vaccinations required for your pet all depend on what type of animal you have. For example, vaccines are common among dogs because it can prevent serious diseases like distemper, rabies and hepatitis. These vaccines are the ones that vets recommend your dog should get as a puppy and last anywhere between 7-15 years. Getting your pet vaccinated can not only protect your pet, but also your family and yourself. Most pet illnesses humans can also get. 

**Every animal is different**. Check with your local vet to find out what vaccines your pet might need. Every breed is different, different types of dogs and cats, for example, are prone to different health risks factoring in breed, health, age, and environment. 

Vaccines can be expensive, so when looking into adopting or buying a pet be sure to weigh in the cost of vaccines that will be needed throughout the animals' life span. We also *highly* recommend looking into the health factors of each breed of varying animals when deciding beforehand. It never hurts to do research when looking for the perfect pet.

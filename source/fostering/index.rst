Fostering Animals
=================

Many times we will reach capacity at our shelter and we will need people to foster animals temporarily until they either find their forever home
or space is available at the shelter. Either way, this is one of the most helpful ways that you can get involved. Typically, you will be fostering 
no more than two animals at a time for ootentially a few days to a few months. We are always in need of new foster families and would love to 
meet with you and talk more about this program. Below you can find more information on becoming a foster family for our shelter, the requirements for our foster families, and also the application. The application process is very important for us and our animals.
We want to ensure that we find the right families for the right animals here at Simpson College Pet Shelter. If you have any questions or would like
more information about our fostering program, please contact Peggy Richardson at peggy.richardson@SCPS.com or call her at 515-877-9087.

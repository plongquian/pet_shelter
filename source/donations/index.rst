Donations
=========

Simpson College Pet Shelter is a non-profit organization and therefore we are 
dependent on others to get our operating budget every year. We have many consistent
donors, but we are always in need of more. Here at Simpson Pet Shelter we accept
donations of all kinds, monetary donations in the form of cash, check, or credit card.
We also accept donations in the form of dog and cat food as well as collars, leashes
and toys for all animals.

Simpson College Pet Shelter's mission.
"Our mission and goal is to provide a suitable temporary shelter to any stray and abandoned animals for the purpose of finding a permanent suitable home for all animals. Additionally, to provide assistance to prevent overpopulation through our neutering programs."

We were started in 1958 with the intent to help any of the abandoned animals in the vicinity of the Simpson College campus. We have the hope that Indianola residents and Simpson College students will adopt for our location.

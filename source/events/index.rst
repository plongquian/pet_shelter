Event Calendar
==============

Here at Simpson College Pet Shelter we have many events that we host at our shelter. We have monthly adoption fairs where we invite the community 
to come out and meet the animals at our shelter and we offer discounted adoptions. In addition we have annual banquets where we raise money 
for our shelter as well as have auctions and raffles. We also offer training classes, more information can be found on the training classes page.
If you would like more information about any of our events you can contact our director of events Richard Toll at rtoll@SCPS.com.
Certain events are ticketed, those events will be marked accordingly in the calendar below.

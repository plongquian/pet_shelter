Event Calendar
==============

Here at Simpson College Pet Shelter, we have many events we host at our facility. We have monthly adoption fairs where we invite the community 
to come out and meet our animals and we offer discounted adoptions. In addition, we have annual banquets where we raise money 
for our shelter, as well as hosting auctions and raffles. We also offer training classes. You are able to find more information on these offered sessions on the Training Classes page. For events that have a fee you can send a check to the shelter or you can sign up using our online sign up genie.
If you are interested in volunteering at any of our events please go to our volunteer page where you can find more information on our volunteering opportunities. 
If you would like more information about any of our events you can contact our director of events, Richard Toll, at rtoll@SCPS.com.
*Certain events are ticketed, and will be marked accordingly in the calendar below.*
*Due to the winter weather we have had to cancel all events for the month of December. We apologize for any inconvenience*

Event Calendar
==============

Here at Simpson College Pet Shelter, we have many events we host at our facility. We have monthly adoption fairs where we invite the community 
to come out and meet our animals and we offer discounted adoptions. In addition, we have annual banquets where we raise money 
for our shelter, as well as hosting auctions and raffles. We also offer training classes. You are able to find more information on these offered sessions on the Training Classes page.
If you would like more information about any of our events you can contact our director of events, Richard Toll, at rtoll@SCPS.com.
Certain events are ticketed, and will be marked accordingly in the calendar below.
